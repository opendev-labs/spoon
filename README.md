**Spoon** is an agentic command-line bridge between your local development environment and the OpenDev-Labs Nexus. It enables autonomous project management, cloud-state synchronization, and AI-driven infrastructure automation.

---

## ⚡ Unified Identity & Cloud

Spoon links your terminal to your global OpenDev-Labs profile.

- `spoon opendev-labs login`: Authenticate with GitHub to bridge your identity.
- `spoon opendev-labs account`: View your unified status, tokens, and cloud-sync age.
- `spoon opendev-labs sync`: Manually trigger a multidimensional state synchronization.

---

## 🏗️ Project Management (Nexus)

Spoon manages all your GitHub repositories as nodes within the Matrix.

- `spoon project list`: Interrogate the Nexus for all available projects.
- `spoon project pull <name>`: Harness a specific project from GitHub into your local space.
- `spoon project push [message]`: Synchronize local modifications back to the remote Nexus.
- `spoon project manage <name> <action>`: Access internal OpenDev-Labs mainframe protocols.

## 🕶️ AI Agent Archetypes

Invoke specialized agents to operate on your codebase.

### **Trinity** (`spoon trinity`)
Your personal assistant. Predicts intent and manages high-level mission state.

### **Tank** (`spoon tank`)
The primary operator. Directly executes shell commands and manages infrastructure.

### **Smith** (`spoon smith`)
The system wrapper. Can harness any external CLI tool and bring it under Spoon control.

### **Mouse** (`spoon mouse`)
The security auditor. Scans code for vulnerabilities and logical inconsistencies.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

- `spoon deploy <target>`: Deploy your creation across all known realms (Vercel, GitHub, OCI).

---

## 📦 System Initialization

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opendev-labs/spoon.git
cd spoon
npm install
./spoon.js opendev-labs login
```
